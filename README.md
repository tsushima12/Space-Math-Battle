🚀 Project: Space Math Battle

⸻

🎯 About the Project

A solo-built, fast-paced arcade math shooter where solving problems fires lasers. No upgrades — just quick thinking, sharp reflexes, and intense space battles.

⸻

💡 Inspiration
	•	Inspired by classic games like Galaga.
	•	I wanted to make math thrilling — not a chore, but a challenge powered by lasers and explosions.

⸻

🛠️ How I Built It
	•	Tech Stack: HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript
	•	Designed and coded everything from scratch — game logic, UI, assets, and math problem generation.
	•	Implemented real-time problem solving and shooting mechanics.
	•	Added sounds and animations for a dynamic game experience.

⸻

📚 What I Learned
	•	Handling real-time input while animating is tough but rewarding.
	•	Balancing difficulty keeps players engaged.
	•	Even small polish — like hit effects — makes the game feel complete.

⸻

🧗 Challenges I Faced
	•	Smooth rendering at 60 FPS with active inputs.
	•	Preventing players from spamming answers.
	•	Doing everything solo — from code to graphics — under time constraints.

✅ Outcome

Built a complete, solo-developed game that turns math into an action-packed space battle. It’s fun, educational, and genuinely addictive.
